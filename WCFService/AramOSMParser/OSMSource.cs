Using System.Xml.Linq in Unity and on iOS
Posted: 05:40 PM 1 Week Ago

    I am so relieved that this works (at least what I've tested so far.)

    People should know, though, that in Unity 4.0 I didn't just have to add a reference to the System.Xml.Linq assembly in MonoDevelop - but I had to actually locate the assembly itself and drag it into my Assets folder.

    That took me a while to figure out because Mono would build just fine but I would get errors about missing namespace System.Xml.Linq when trying to run it in the Editor (much less iOS.)

    I did have a hiccup at one time where Unity reported that the AOT compile failed relating to link but I shut down Mono and Unity and did a complete rebuild and it worked just fine again.

    Linq is a great time saver Thanks for the great work Unity team!

    Hans

    P.S. I used the version 3.5 System.Xml.Linq assembly.
